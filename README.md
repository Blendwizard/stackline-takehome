# Summary

A fun front end exercise utilizing React/Redux (RTK).
This was my first foray into Redux and deploying with Github pages and both resulted in a great learning experience. 
#### Tech Stack
* React
* Redux/RTK
* ChartJS

## Development Process
I started with a miniature design document to chart a course on tackling the provided wireframe and to keep track of the dependencies I would need. It also gave me a point of reference in my development process to fall back on if necessary.
 

## Challenges
**Redux**
* Redux offers a different perspective on state management and it shines as an application scales in complexity and size. Having never needed Redux myself, I found applying it to be a similar experience to learning React and Props the first time around. Challenging but rewarding.

**Github Pages**
* Github pages offers a convenient way to host static applications. Having only used AWS, it took a few tries and a bit of reading before I realized I needed to expose my bundled application to the root directory. 

**Line Chart**
* The sales data I plugged into my chart component often had large deltas between data points resulting in a poor visualization with a lot of the default settings. It took a lot of tweaking in the chart options before the data could be somewhat presentable.

## Takeaways
* I had a ton of fun trying to complete this project to the specifications, especially with the Redux challenges.
* Not using create-react-app means more time spent on setting up boilerplate webpack/babel configs.
* Leverage design documents and plan ahead.
* Scaffold UI components.
* Don't try to learn Redux in 24 hours.
